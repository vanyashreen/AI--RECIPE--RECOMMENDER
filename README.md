# AI Recipe Recommender System

## Overview
This project is an **AI-powered Recipe Recommender System** that provides personalized recipe suggestions based on user preferences, dietary requirements, and available ingredients. By analyzing users' ingredients, past preferences, and dietary constraints, the system recommends suitable recipes to enhance user engagement, promote healthier eating, and simplify meal planning.

The project demonstrates the integration of AI with traditional web development technologies to deliver an intelligent, interactive, and practical application.

## How It Works
1. Users enter available ingredients, dietary preferences, and past recipe likes/dislikes.  
2. The system sends this data to the Python AI module via an API.  
3. The AI module analyzes the input and generates a ranked list of suitable recipes.  
4. Recommendations are displayed on the web interface for users to view and interact with.
